# TableTime

-Current Status


    -Contains all of the code for the Sub-Site to be accessed from a mobile device upon scanning a Table's QR Code
    
    -Site currently only contains loading and fade-in animations three main buttons lack functionality (they currently point to Google but eventually will be reworked to lead to their respective site functions.)
    
    -Site is intended to be linked with Table Database and be able to modify it according to user specifications
    
    -Could potentially add local password authentication against data from JSON file and AJAX, as well as "fake" database modification (maybe Google's Firebase?)
    
    -Uses Bootstrap for CSS and Animations
